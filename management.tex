\section{Project Timeline and Activities}
\label{sec:man}

The work plan for this project is given in Figure~\ref{fig:workplan} in a quarterly breakdown based on the research goals listed for each research thrust in section~\ref{sec:research}.
The goals found in \hyperref[sec:t1]{Thrust~1} are in \textcolor{cyan}{cyan}, the goals found in \hyperref[sec:t2]{Thrust~2} are in \textcolor{green}{green}, and the goal found in \hyperref[sec:t3]{Thrust~3} are in \textcolor{magenta}{magenta}.

Since our thrusts are largely independent, they begin executing in parallel.
In particular, we already have preliminary work on Goals~\ref{goal:spawn} and \ref{goal:strong-epp}, so we plan to begin the starting period of the grant by working on those.
Our preliminary work suggests that the ``radical'' work on new bisimulations (Goal~\ref{goal:strong-epp}) will take some time, which is why it is spread over six quarters.
However, we expect the choreographic-feature development of Goals~\ref{goal:spawn}, \ref{goal:multirecv}, and~\ref{goal:wait-until-called} will take approximately equal amounts of time.
We thus sequentialize them, overlapping by one quarter to represent beginning the work on one while preparing the previous for publication.

We save the implementation tasks (Goals~\ref{goal:opt-epp} and~\ref{goal:benchmark}) to the end of the grant period so that we can implement as many of the features we plan to develop as possible.
We can also start to assemble a benchmark (Goal~\ref{goal:benchmark}) almost immediately after we begin implementation.
This is seen in Figure~\ref{fig:workplan} by the bar for Goal~\ref{goal:benchmark} starting in Year 2, Quarter 4, while the bar for the main implementation goal (Goal~\ref{goal:opt-epp}) begins one quarter earlier.
