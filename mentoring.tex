This grant provides for two graduate students hosted at the University at Buffalo, one mentored by PI~Hirsch and one by Co-PI~Ziarek.
These students will be mentored according to the plan below.

\paragraph{Setting and Communicating (Bidirectional) Expectations}
Each student will get at least one hour a week in one-on-one meetings with their supervisor in addition to any project meetings.
Moreover, PI~Hirsch and Co-PI~Ziarek maintain an open-door policy: they makes time for impromptu questions and conversations with research students.
These policies ensure that there is a constant bidirectional line of communication between the senior personnel and their students.

Since the research is to be done collaboratively, we plan to have regular four-way communication.
This is eased by the fact that PI~Hirsch and co-PI~Ziarek share a lab space, with physical space for their students to sit together regularly.
This space not only allows regular impromptu communication, but allows the PI and co-PI to easily schedule joint meetings.
We expect such joint meetings to be regular, and for our students to work together on all stages of the grant.

\paragraph{Tailoring the Plan}

All students are different, and all students grow and mature during the course of their research experiences.
As such, plans and expectations are in a constant state of flux, in order to align with a student's (dynamic) needs.
This is provided for in large part by one-on-one meetings and open-door policy, both of which allow a student to raise concerns and for the PI and co-PI to monitor their students' progress and needs (including needs they may not be able to detect or advocate for themselves).   Together the PIs have over 15 years of experience advising Ph.D. level students with individually tailored mentoring plans. Co-PI~Ziarek has graduated 5 Ph.D. students and 2 co-advised Ph.D. students.   Additionally, Co-PI~Ziarek is PI-Hirsch's faculty mentor, allowing for a natural mechanism for the PIs to share prior experiences mentoring students with one another.



\paragraph{Promoting a Supportive Work Environment}

PI~Hirsch believes strongly in lab culture, and works hard to promote participation in lab culture.
This provides students more than fun: it also provides a support network of students of all maturity levels and even faculty.
As such, the PI and co-PI's shared lab space is a significant source of graduate-student culture in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at UB.

Moreover, both PIs one-on-one meetings ensure that students have a time when they can bring up any issues which are concerning them.
This is one of the reasons that these one-on-one meetings are so important: they allow students to open up when they would not do so in other situations.

\paragraph{Assessing Progress}
Student progress is mostly measured by research progress and progress completing training tasks as described above.
Any issues they have are caught early thanks to the constant contact between the senior personnel and their students.
Moreover, the Computer Science and Engineering department at UB requires all students to be assessed annually.
Any students who raise concerns are then given mentoring by another department member.  Students are also evaluated annually at the department
level, which provides an external evaluation of progress.
