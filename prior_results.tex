\paragraph{Ethan Cecchetti}
\textbf{(a) Award:} SHF-2504579; \$300,000; 2025-07-01 -- 2028-06-30
\textbf{(b) Title:} ``Foundations of Zero Knowledge Computation''
\textbf{(c) Intellectual Merit:} We are building tools and theory for programming systems that use non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) proofs,
including simplifying common programming patterns and building language-based approaches to end-to-end security analysis of NIZK systems.
\textbf{(d) Broader Impacts:} This project will make it easier to build and secure a rapidly growing landscape of deployed systems relying on NIZK proofs for correctness and security.
\textbf{(e) Publications:} No publications have been produced under this award since it began 2 months ago.

\paragraph{Andrew Hirsch}
\textbf{(a) Award:} 2512151; \$598,636.00; 2025-09-01 -- 2028-08-01
\textbf{(b) Title:} ``SHF: Small: Open Choreographies via Session Types''
\textbf{(c) Intellectual Merit}: This project focuses on building choreographic languages that allow processes that are not part of the choreography to interact with the choreography.
\textbf{(d) Broader Impacts}: This project will allow choreographic programs to participate in open systems, such as systems that include commodity hardware.
This ability has the potential to allow choreographies to be applicable in many new situations.
\textbf{(e) Publications}: No publications have yet been produced under this award.
