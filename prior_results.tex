\paragraph{Ethan Cecchetti}
\textbf{Award:} SHF-2504579; \$300,000; 2025-07-01 -- 2028-06-30
\textbf{Title:} ``Foundations of Zero Knowledge Computation''
\textbf{Intellectual Merit:} We are building tools and theory for programming with non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs
to ease development of applications using these primitives and provide language-based approaches to end-to-end security analysis.
\textbf{Broader Impacts:} \todo{Fill this in}
\textbf{Publications:} No publications have been produced under this award in the 2 months since it began.

\paragraph{Andrew Hirsch}
\textbf{(a) Award:} 2512151; \$598,636.00; 2025-09-01 -- 2028-08-01
\textbf{(b) Title:} ``SHF: Small: Open Choreographies via Session Types''
\textbf{(c) Intellectual Merit}: This project focuses on building choreographic languages that allow processes that are not part of the choreography to interact with the choreography.
\textbf{(d) Broader Impacts}: This project will allow choreographic programs to participate in open systems, such as systems that include commodity hardware.
This ability has the potential to allow choreographies to be applicable in many new situations.
\textbf{(e) Publications}:No publications have yet been produced under this award.
